# BusinessTicketingSystem
Develop a ticketing system that will show items such as ticket#, name and so on for a business in order to streamline efficiency, keep everything organized and manage workload.

This serves to Scrape emails received by an Outlook account (Outlook must be installed locally and must be .exe), upload them to a database using properties such as email address,
name, subject etc. The database will then upload these properties as a "ticket" to a webserver, where users can login and view the information. The database is a hosted on a Virutal Machine running MYSQL. The connection and webserver are being ran by a python package called Django.
